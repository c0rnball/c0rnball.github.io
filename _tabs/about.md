Hello, I'm Jyoti Rupaal — once a spirited city girl immersed in civilian commotion, now a proud bearer of olive green memories and traditions. Life took a delightful turn when matrimony led me into the structured yet spirited world of the armed forces, where parades, postings, power cuts and perfectly timed smiles were not mere occurrences, they became art forms in adaptation.

Over the years, I've donned many hats — from travel executive to school principal, from Asia International Crown holder to a ramp walking multitasker capable of hosting seamless soirées, resolving last minute decor dilemmas and conjuring cakes that healed hearts and elevated moods.

Though the days of packed trunks and the unmistakable scent of starch are now fond memories, the fauji spirit continues to shape my words, my kitchen and my humour. Life didn't decelerate, it simply took a new path — one that now includes this blog, my newest chapter.

Here, I unwrap stories , the chaotic, the charming and the deeply cherished. Whether you are a fellow fauji spouse, a seeker of nostalgia or simply a lover of stories woven with warmth, wit and authenticity, you're in the right place.

For every woman who's worn multiple identities with grace, this treasure chest of tales is yours too.

Welcome home.
