There are certain constants in army life. Parade at sunrise. Tea at four. And Ladies Club meets that run smoother than a drill on Republic Day.

So when a Thursday morning meet themed Garden Glamour began with ladies gliding in chiffon sarees, sipping rose infused coolers and gracefully collecting their tambola tickets at the entrance, no one expected that the only thing to truly vanish would not be a lucky draw gift but a whole carrot cake.

## The Setup

It was all going so well. The lawns were picture perfect, the decorations straight out of a wedding magazine (the tasteful kind, not the glitter burst ones) and the Bake & Bring table was a showstopper.

There were tarts so tiny you needed binoculars, soufflés trembling with elegance and then at the centre - the pièce de résistance - a majestic triple layer carrot cake created by the soft spoken but fiercely talented Mrs. Ritu Malhotra.

Its frosting swirled like a marble sculpture with almond slivers arranged in a pattern so symmetrical that some believed it had been designed using graph paper.

The senior most lady from the organising branch, Mrs. Aparna Kaul, led the preparations with effortless charm. Dressed in a soft sea green chiffon she floated more than walked.

Her reputation? Impeccable.
Her judgment? Sharper than the knives in the pantry drawer.

## 1100 hrs. Chaos in Chiffon

Just as the judging was about to begin, a quiet murmur rippled through the gathering.

"The carrot cake's gone."

Gone. Not shifted. Not covered. Gone.

Gasps were stifled behind pursed lips. Someone clutched her tambola ticket a little tighter. Another instinctively rechecked her handbag (as if the cake might be hiding there).

Mrs. Kaul raised one elegant eyebrow, the kind that could signal either concern or an incoming General's arrival.

## The Sleuthing Begins

No names were named. No panic. Just precise steps taken quietly and efficiently.

The pantry was checked. The dessert counters examined. Nothing.
The helper staff asked gently. No clues.

But army wives, especially experienced ones, know one universal truth:
When in doubt look near the air conditioning.

Sure enough, after a quick internal check, a key detail emerged.
The backup service platters prepped for post event tea had been moved to the shaded verandah near the buffet.

A soft clatter and a faint "oh dear" later, a slice of frosted truth was revealed - the cake had been mistakenly pre cut, plated and sent off with the post judging snacks.

By whom? No one knew.
Why? A label had fallen off.
How many pieces left? Precisely three.
Who had eaten it? Everyone - without realizing they were tasting the star entry.

## Mrs. Kaul's Verdict

She looked at the nearly empty platter.
Then at the delighted, unsuspecting faces of the ladies who had already had second helpings.

Well,she said, with a smile that could settle debates and storm clouds alike,
"If the cake was devoured before it could be judged... that, ladies, is your winner."

Applause broke out. Tambola resumed.
A lucky draw gift went to someone who had spent most of the morning eyeing the almond soufflé.

And the carrot cake?
It achieved legend status - mostly because it had vanished in style.

## Epilogue

Nothing made it into the club records, of course. This was not the kind of thing one documents.

But long after the chiffon was folded and the chairs stacked, the story of the cake that disappeared and won anyway, remained a favourite.

Because in an army ladies' meet, everything is under control.

Until dessert goes rogue.
