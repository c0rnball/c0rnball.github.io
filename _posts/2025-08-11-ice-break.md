## A Night of Glitz Grit And Cool Rescue

It was a formal summer dinner at the Officers' Mess in Lucknow, hosted in honour of the Army Commander and his wife. The lawns were glowing under strings of delicate lights, a soft breeze stirred the elegant sarees of the ladies and tables gleamed under crisp linen with napkins folded into intricate crests. Everything looked flawless.

Guests were to arrive by 7:00 PM and the Army Commander and his wife were expected at 7:30 PM sharp. Drinks were scheduled to begin the moment the Army Commander arrived. By 6:45 PM, the hosts — officers and their wives were already in place, calm on the surface but mentally ticking through last minute checks.

Everything seemed under control.

Almost.

## Trouble In The Chill Zone

At 6:45 PM, just as the final touches were being checked, the Mess Havaldar opened the fridge and the deep freezer for one last inspection. That's when he froze. 

Both fridge and deep freezer had failed. The bottles were warming. The ice had melted into water. And the star of the night — the layered cream-soaked tipsy pudding was sliding dangerously into slush. Alongside it the ice cream was losing its shape fast.

The Havaldar's face lost all colour. Everything had been fine at 4:30 PM. But now both appliances had given up in the worst way possible — by refusing to stay cold.

Within moments, the Mess Secretary and Adjutant were on their feet taking charge of the crisis. Mess waiters were summoned quietly but swiftly. There was very little time left before the first guest walked in. This was not a small hiccup. This was a full blown cold-chain collapse.

## Mission Ice Covert Ops Begin

There was no room for loud reactions. Just sharp instinct.

Word reached the ladies — one by one — passed like well practised theatre cues. They didn't gasp or panic. They got into action quietly and with purpose.

Some slipped away before the party started. Others had to step out in the middle of the party itselfeach armed with a convincing excuse:

"I'll just check if the children are settled in their room."
"Let me ensure the bouquet is placed properly for the First Lady."
"I'll just go around the corner for a minute."

Not a single guest suspected a thing — proof that if Army wives ever wanted to run an espionage network, it would be unstoppable.

One officer's house, blessed with two refrigerators — became the official rescue zone. Two big bowls of tipsy pudding and tubs of ice cream were carried there and placed in the fridge and freezer.

Mess waiters began gathering ice from every direction — tucked into boxes, containers and even tiffins. They moved swiftly blending into the evening without a trace.

## Tip Toeing Through Disaster

By 7:30 PM, the Army Commander and his wife arrived. And just as planned, drinks were served. Glasses clinked with laughter and… the very ice that had made a swift covert dash from the neighbourhood.

Inside the Mess Dining Hall, dinner was laid to perfection. The hosts moved with composure. The ladies didn't have the luxury to exchange glances across the lawn but they were operating like a perfectly timed orchestra.

Desserts were scheduled to be served as soon as dinner ended and every second till then mattered.

The ice cream regained its form. The warm halwa stayed warm. The tipsy pudding now back to its proud layers, waited like royalty.

## A Chill Ending With A Warm Laugh

When desserts were finally served, the Army Commander took a bite of the tipsy, smiled and said:

"This has to be one of the best tipsy puddings I've had — chilled just right. In fact the best I've had after NDA!"

We could have burst out laughing right there because if only he knew that his "perfectly chilled" pudding had survived more travel than an officer on field posting.

## Why This Night Still Lives On

Because in the Army, even a dinner isn't just a dinner. It's a mission carried out with teamwork, precision and grace under pressure. That night when the sky nearly fell in the form of melting ice and slushy pudding, we didn't let it show. We fixed it — calmly, collectively and beautifully.

After all, some victories are best served chilled — preferably with dessert that hasn't just been rescued from a fridge failure… but has also claimed posting allowance for extra mileage.
